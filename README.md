# Predicting Next Pitch - Fastball vs Offspeed

### Problem Statement

Strategy in Major League Baseball is ever involving. With hitters increasingly focused 
on launch angles and elevating the ball, it is unsurprising that teams are becoming more 
reliant on home runs to score. In fact, in 2019 the teams collectively hit an eye-popping 
6,776 home runs, which is roughly a 10% increase over the previous record of 6,105 
home runs hit in 2017. This trend is very likely to continue in the coming seasons. 

The goal of this project is to build a model that attempts to accurately predict when a 
pitcher will throw a fastball. The targeted clients for this model are professional, 
semi-professional, and collegiate baseball teams, including the players, managers, and 
other personnel. The organizations could use this data to inform their batters to 
anticipate fastballs under certain circumstances, which in turn should lead to the team 
hitting more home runs. Conversely, organizations could use this information to inform 
their pitchers as to when fastballs are most often thrown and coach the pitchers to throw 
a different pitch under those circumstances. Professional sports gamblers could also 
use the model to inform their wagers. These are just a handful of what is likely many 
uses for an accurate fastball prediction model.
